## *Purpose of Portfolio Website*
The purpose of this portfolio website is to introduce myself and be able to showcase my coding/programming skills. There are two main goals that I want my portfolio website to achieve, which are can be broken down into **user stories**:

* "**As a developer**, I want to be able to showcase what I have done throughout my coding journey and have a way for recruiters to contact me so that I have a higher chance of getting into the industry".
  
* "**As a recruiter**, I want to get to know this person and see their skills and projects they have completed because this will help me gain an understanding of whether this person is a great fit for the company".
